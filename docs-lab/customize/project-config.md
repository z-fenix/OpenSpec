# Project configuration

> Make the workflows plan changes the way you want with a few lines in config.yaml.

`openspec/config.yaml` tells the workflows how you want changes planned.

For example, the following configuration updates the creation rules for the [tasks.md](../reference/schemas/spec-driven/index.md) artifact:

```yaml
rules:
  tasks:
    - End every task with a commit
```

When the agent runs, it pulls from these rules and ensures every task ends with a commit step.

Keep rules short. Everything here lands in the agent's context, and verbose rules can make the output worse.

## How it works

config.yaml holds instructions the agent receives when it creates artifacts or works through the workflow.

Here's what happens on every run:

1. You run a workflow (e.g. `/openspec-propose`).
2. The agent calls the [`openspec instructions`](../reference/cli.md) command.
3. The command reads your context and rules from config.yaml.
4. OpenSpec's built-in instructions and your customizations are combined into a single prompt for the agent.
5. The agent follows that prompt to write the artifact.

For example, with a `context` field and the rule from the top of this page, here's what [`openspec instructions`](../reference/cli.md) returns for tasks.md (trimmed and annotated):

```xml
<artifact id="tasks" change="add-dark-mode" schema="spec-driven">

  <!-- From your config.yaml: context -->
  <project_context>
    Tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js
    Domain: e-commerce platform
  </project_context>

  <!-- From your config.yaml: rules for tasks -->
  <rules>
    - End every task with a commit
  </rules>

  <!-- From OpenSpec: the built-in guidance -->
  <instruction>
    ...how to write a good tasks.md...
  </instruction>

  <template>
    ...the tasks.md structure to fill in...
  </template>

</artifact>
```

Your config arrives first, then OpenSpec's built-in instruction and template. Rules add to the built-ins and never replace them. Edits to config.yaml reach the agent on the next run.

[Workflow runs](../reference/architecture/workflow-runs.md) covers the full run, from invocation to written artifacts.

## The fields

Three fields shape what the agent receives. Each field's exact contract (types, limits, validation) is in [Project configuration (config.yaml)](../reference/configuration/config-yaml.md).

| Field | What it does | Injected into |
|---|---|---|
| `context` | Instructions the agent always receives | Everything: every artifact, `apply`, `archive` |
| `rules` | Extra instructions for one artifact | Only that artifact's creation |
| `operations` | Guidance for how a workflow step is carried out | Only `apply` and `archive` |
| `artifacts_dir` | The directory (relative to the project root) holding `changes/` and `specs/` | Nothing — read at command dispatch to locate artifacts |

config.yaml's other fields (`schema`, `store`, `references`) select which schema and which OpenSpec root a project uses. The contract page covers them.

The last column is exact, so a field reaches only the steps listed there. In particular, `verify` never receives `rules`. It checks the implementation against the artifacts as written.

### context

`context` is what the agent should know up front when planning a change, whether it's creating an artifact, applying tasks, or archiving:

```yaml
context: |
  We ship cross-platform; designs and tasks must cover Windows, macOS, and Linux
  Tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js, Commander.js
  We use conventional commits
```

This is planning context, not project documentation. Add a fact when it should shape every plan, like the cross-platform line above. Leave out anything the agent can learn by reading the code.

**Another language**: because context reaches every artifact, it's also how you change the output language. One line, like `Write all artifacts in Spanish.`, switches every proposal, spec, and tasks file the workflows write.

### rules

`rules` attach to one artifact, keyed by artifact id. Each line is added to that artifact's built-in guidance:

```yaml
rules:
  proposal:
    - Keep proposals under 500 words
  tasks:
    - Every UI task includes a Playwright test
```

Proposals now stay short and tasks.md always plans browser tests. Every other artifact is untouched.

### operations

`operations` guides how the agent carries out `apply` and `archive`, rather than what artifacts say:

```yaml
operations:
  apply:
    guidance:
      - Run the linter before marking a task complete
  archive:
    guidance:
      - Summarize what shipped before archiving
```

During apply, the agent lints as it completes tasks. During archive, it closes with a summary.

### artifacts_dir

`artifacts_dir` relocates the artifacts — `changes/`, `changes/archive/`, and `specs/` — out from under `openspec/`:

```yaml
artifacts_dir: docs/openspec
```

The value is a path relative to the project root; absolute paths and `..` segments are rejected. `openspec/` keeps `config.yaml` and any project-local `schemas/`; commands read `artifacts_dir` to find `changes/` and `specs/` elsewhere.

With the value above, the layout is:

```text
openspec/
  config.yaml
docs/openspec/
  changes/
  specs/
```

Omitting the key keeps the legacy single-root layout (everything under `openspec/`). `openspec init` writes `artifacts_dir: docs/openspec` for new projects from the [spec-driven schema](../reference/schemas/spec-driven/index.md) default; existing projects are never migrated.

## When config.yaml isn't enough

Config adds instructions on top of the standard workflow, but it can't change which artifacts exist or how they're structured. When you want that level of control, or rules aren't steering behavior consistently, [fork a schema](schemas.md).
